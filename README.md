# Create A Token

This Solidity program implements a simple token contract named "PrimeToken" with basic token functionalities like minting and burning. It serves as an introduction to Solidity and token mechanics on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Description

This contract, written in Solidity, defines a token called "ACoin" (abbreviation "ACN"). It includes functions to mint and burn tokens, tracking the total supply and balances of addresses. This project is ideal for beginners looking to understand solidity concepts.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To run this program, use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. Visit [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

#### 1. Create a New File:

Click the "+" icon in the left sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g. PrimeToken.sol).

#### 2. Copy and Paste the Code given in the [Token Creation](https://github.com/buzyvibhsss/PrimeToken/commit/bb253767107f320bc67a84d7697141432e9f03ff) file.

#### 3. Compile the Code:

Click the "Solidity Compiler" tab. Ensure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.9". Click "Compile PrimeToken.sol".

#### 4. Deploy the Contract:

Click the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab. Select "PrimeToken" from the dropdown menu. Click "Deploy".

#### 5. Interact with the Contract:

Call mintFunc to mint tokens by specifying the address and amount. Call burnFunc to burn tokens by specifying the address and amount. The contract updates balances and total supply accordingly.
